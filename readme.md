# PhoneGap Plugin for the Dropbox Sync API (Android Version) #

A PhoneGap plugin for the [Dropbox Sync API](https://www.DropboxSync.com/developers/sync).

Read my blog post [here](http://rossmartindev.blogspot.com/2013/08/phonegap-plugin-for-dropbox-sync-api.html)

Installation
-----------
This plugin is compatible with [PhoneGap 3.0+ CLI](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.0.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-line%20Interface_add_features) and [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman), here's how to add it using the CLI:

```
cordova plugin add https://github.com/rossmartin/phonegap-dropbox-sync-android.git
```

Use the [Dropbox Apps Console](https://www.dropbox.com/login?cont=https%3A//www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) to create your own Dropbox application.  Add your Dropbox app key to AndroidManifest.xml.  [Add this app key and secret to the DropboxSync.java class that is acquired when installing the plugin](https://github.com/rossmartin/phonegap-dropbox-sync-android/blob/master/src/Android/DropboxSync.java#l45).

Add these 3 JavaScript functions to your app that handle native callbacks:
```
function dropbox_linked() { }
// Called from the onActivityResult method in the plugin when linking is successful.
```
```
function dropbox_onSyncStatusChange(status) { }
// Called by observer in the plugin when there's a change 
// to the status of background synchronization (download/upload).
// status is a string variable that will be 'sync' or 'none'.
```
```
function dropbox_fileChange() { }
// Called by observer in the plugin when a file is changed.
```

[You can see how these native callbacks are used in the sample app provided](https://github.com/rossmartin/phonegap-dropbox-sync-android/blob/sample/www/js/app.js#l217).
Usage
-----------
Link to Dropbox:
```
DropboxSync.link();
```

Check Dropbox Authentication (persistent):
```
DropboxSync.checkLink(function() { // success
    // User is already authenticated with Dropbox.
}, function() { // fail
    // User is not authenticated with Dropbox.
});
// Authentication status will persist between runs of your app.
```

Add an observer (invokes a callback when Dropbox files/folders change):
```
var dropboxPath = '/';

DropboxSync.addObserver(dropboxPath);
// When an observer is added to a path, JavaScript callbacks
// 'dropbox_fileChange' and 'dropbox_onSyncStatusChange'
// will get invoked when a file/folder is changed or when
// a background synchronization (download/upload) occurs.
// The observer watches changes in child directories also.
```

List a Dropbox folder:
```
var dropboxFolderPath = '/'; // root app dir in this case

DropboxSync.listFolder(dropboxFolderPath, function(files) { // success
    // Each object in files have properties: path, modifiedTime, size, and isFolder.
}, function() { // fail
    // Handle error in fail callback.
});
```

Upload a file to Dropbox:
```
DropboxSync.uploadFile({
    filePath: 'file:///storage/sdcard0/DCIM/Camera/SomeVideo.mp4', // required, local URI
    dropboxPath: '/someFolder' // optional, defaults to root ('/')
}, function() { // success
    // dropboxPath is the Dropbox folder you want to upload the file into.
}, function() { // fail
    // Handle error in fail callback.
});
```

Upload a folder to Dropbox:
```
DropboxSync.uploadFolder({
    folderPath: 'file:///storage/sdcard0', // required
    dropboxPath: '/someFolder', // optional, defaults to root ('/')
    doRecursive: true // optional, defaults to false
}, function() { // success
    // dropboxFolderPath is the Dropbox folder you want to upload the files/folders into.
    // The folder upload can be done recursively by setting doRecursive to true.
}, function() { // fail
    // Handle error in fail callback.
});
```

Open a Dropbox file:
```
var filePath = '/foo/bar.jpg';

DropboxSync.openFile(filePath, function() { // success
    // Android device will either open the file with the proper external application
    // installed on your device or ask you which application to use.
}, function() { // fail
    // Handle error in fail callback.
});
```

Create a new folder in Dropbox:
```
var folderPath = '/foo/bar';

DropboxSync.createFolder(folderPath, function() { // success
    // Creates a new folder, including parent folders if necessary.
}, function() { // fail
    // Handle error in fail callback.
});
```

Delete a file/folder in Dropbox:
```
var filePath = '/foo/bar.json';

DropboxSync.deleteFile(filePath, function() { // success
    // Deletes a file, or recursively deletes a folder.
}, function() { // fail
    // Handle error in fail callback.
});
```

Read a file in Dropbox:
```
var filePath = '/foo/bar.json';

DropboxSync.readString(filePath, function(result) { // success
    // Reads the contents of a file (result is a string).
}, function() { // fail
    // Handle error in fail callback.
});
```

Get the Base64 decoded string from an image in Dropbox
(use an image from Dropbox in your app):
```
var filePath = '/foobar.jpg';

DropboxSync.getImageBase64String(filePath, function(result) { // success
    $('#image').attr('src', 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + result);
    // result is the Base64-encoded string.
}, function() { // fail
    // Handle error in fail callback.
});
```

Unlink from Dropbox:
```
DropboxSync.unlink(function() { // success
    // Do something here after unlinked.
}, function() { // fail
    // Handle error in fail callback.
});
```

Updates

***```5-22-14```***<br>**- Made plugin installable via CLI and Plugman.**<br>

***```3-8-14```***<br>**- Removed use of the "getImageBase64String" & "readString" methods in the sample app.  Now Android device will either open the file with proper external application installed on your device or ask you which application to use.**<br>

***```3-4-14```***<br>**- Added ability to delete files/folders and create new folders in the Dropbox plugin.**<br>
**- Updated sample app UI with Topcoat Effeckts.  Added Topcoat overlay and off screen nav menu with Effeckt CSS that uses webkit animations and transforms.**<br>

***```2-24-14```***<br>**- Updated sample app to PhoneGap 3.4.0 and added pull to refresh feature on Dropbox list.**

***```2-15-14```***<br>**- Added iScroll 5 and a scroll caching feature to the sample app.**
 
 ***```1-14-14```***<br>**- The sample app is now using handlebars.js, fastclick.js, and pageslider.js**<br>
**- Only 1 view is in the DOM at a time now, this improved performance a lot**<br>
**- The sample app requires API 19 (Android 4.4.2) SDK to build and run.  This is a result of upgrading to PhoneGap 3.3.1**
